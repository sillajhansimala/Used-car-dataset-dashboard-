# Used-car-dataset-dashboard-

## Overview
This project is an interactive dashboard created in Excel to analyze and visualize a dataset of used cars. The dashboard provides insights into key metrics such as car prices, mileage, and transmission type distribution. The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle.

## Process
1. **Dataset Source**: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, which contains information about used cars, including their brand, model, year, mileage, asking price, and more.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: All data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using Excel. This included handling missing values, formatting data for analysis, and calculating new columns like the car's age.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: After preprocessing, the dashboard was built in Excel with interactive visualizations and slicers for enhanced usability.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
1. **Average Price of Cars**: Displays the overall average asking price of cars.
2. **Average Age of Cars**: Calculates and displays the average age of cars in the dataset.
3. **Top 10 Cars by Average Prices**: A bar chart showcasing the top 10 cars with the highest average asking prices.
4. **Mileage Distribution of Used Cars**: A radial chart visualizing the mileage range across the dataset.
5. **Impact of Age on Asking Price**: A scatter plot analyzing the correlation between a carâ€™s age and its asking price, with positive and negative data points differentiated by color.
6. **Heatmap**: Transmission Type Popularity Across Brands. 
   - Instead of copying the data directly into the dashboard, a **hyperlink** was used to navigate to the heatmap for a cleaner interface.

### Interactive Features
The dashboard includes **three slicers** for filtering data dynamically:
1. **Transmission Type**: Filter cars by Manual or Automatic transmission.
2. **Fuel Type**: Filter by fuel type (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
3. **Owner Type**: Filter by ownership type (First, Second, etc.).

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.
- **Kaggle**: As the source of the used car dataset.
- **Hyperlink Integration**: Used hyperlinks to improve dashboard organization and navigate to detailed heatmap visualizations.

## How to Use
1. **Download the Dashboard**: Clone this repository or download the Excel file directly from the repository.
2. **Open in Excel**: Open the `.xlsx` file using Microsoft Excel (or a compatible program).
3. **Interact with the Dashboard**: Use slicers to filter the data dynamically and explore different visualizations.
4. **Analyze Insights**: Leverage charts and heatmaps to gain insights into the used car market.

## Future Enhancements
- Add trend analysis for asking prices based on posting month and year.
- Incorporate geographic data for regional analysis.
- Expand interactivity by using advanced visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
